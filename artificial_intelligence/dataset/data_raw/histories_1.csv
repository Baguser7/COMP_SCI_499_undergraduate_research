I was wondering if you had some time today, man. I would love to bless you with a haircut. You take a knee, boy? I think I can make you look pretty good, man. Sure. I'm positive. What are you going to do now? Right here. I got my table and my chair. Sure. Why not? Very good. Come on, man. I got you. What is your name and what do you do? Glenn and I'm a software developer. And how long have you been a software developer for? 26 years. It's a long time to be in a career field. Yeah. Same company, too. Oh, wow. That's a blessing even more. It really is. So, working for it. See, I'm 58 now. So, I'm hoping 62. That's what I'm hoping to shoot. A couple more years. That's a long more years. A couple more years. You're almost there. How do you feel? I know people have had that problem where, you know, they don't like their 50s. I mean, I really enjoy my 50s. What is the best part about being 50? I think just the relaxation, not worrying so much about things and the boring. I'm not worrying about how people would perceive you. I'm just going to worry about you about that. What do you think is the biggest difference from your generation to this one? I think this generation is much for you to, you know, explore things that, when I was growing up, I don't think we had the opportunity to do it and and I hope that you can get a better job. And then, you know, we have to have this, and that you will have to look at things in your own way as a youngster, and that you will be able to experience what you are doing. What is the best part about being 50? I think just the relaxation. Not worrying so much about things and the boring. Not worrying about how people would perceive you. the up to you, the dude, and the opportunities that come forward in that I don't think we have a murion. I could definitely agree to that. I mean this generation stands up for the rights a lot, whether people like to give us credit for it or not, but we believe in equality in a big way so acceptance of a person for whoever they are has been so big for us. Yeah. You stay by yourself? Yeah, live by yourself. Never marry or anything so yeah. Was that ever a goal for you? I think when you're younger you expect that you're just going to get married, but over time you just realize that maybe there's just not somebody that you really are interested. I know how you got good friends, that's what I have now. Have you gave up the idea of being married? No. No. You never know man. Who knows if this haircut I do. Might have somebody for you by the time you get home man. You can never give up on the idea of love though. You can. That is true. I love that man. I mean I am dating someone right now. Okay. And we get along really well and I think we're a good match. You know, just playing it by ear and seeing how it feels about each other. It's the best way to do it man. It's a play by ear. Take it day by day. What do you think the best piece of advice that you ever heard? Be kind. Just to be kind of people. You don't know what people are going through at the end of your time. And so don't just assume you know what somebody is going through. Any kind of people is something I think is getting lost. I think it's the most important thing to be kind to our shoulders. We never know how far one small gesture can do for somebody. Oh look at that dude. You look like I'm looking smooth. Yes sir. Yes sir. It's good. I like it. And I appreciate you.

And the price of it actually really surprised me. I'm just trying to get the biggest burrito possible. Now don't get me wrong, I really love Chipotle, but in the past two years they've increased their prices four times. Per reference the normal burrito that I ordered cost almost $17. So is it more affordable to get a monster burrito instead? They put down three tortillas and started loading it with stuff, starting with white rice and triple black beans. At this point they already needed two people to move it to the side. They then put three scoops of chicken in all of the toppings, tomato, hot sauce, sour cream, corn, cheese, double guacamole and lettuce. But when they try to roll it up, it did not go as planned. With the power of two people they couldn't get everything to fit into the three tortillas, so they grabbed another one and added it to the middle. But these employees had some serious burrito rolling skills and after a bit of struggling they were finally able to roll it up and make the biggest burrito I have ever seen.

I read it, and I was amazed how badly it's worth it. I just put three down. I figured that's what they wanted. The three students were confident none of the listed answers were correct, and their letters showed it. As a director at the testing service recalled, they didn't say they had come up with possible alternative answers, or that maybe we were wrong. They said flat out, you're wrong, and they proved it. I discussed it with some other people, and said, I think there was a mistake, and they mostly said, and I don't care. I wrote a letter to the educational testing service. It was a little while later. They called us and said, I was correct. Here is their arguments. The simplest version of this problem is with two identical coins. These have the exact same circumference. By our initial logic, this coin should rotate exactly once as it rolls around the other. Let's try it. Okay. But wait, we can see it's already right side up at the halfway point. If we finish rolling it around the other coin, it'll have rotated not once, but twice. One of the coins are the exact same size. There are no tricks here. You can try it for yourself, and I'll do it again slowly. It's one. Two. This is now as the coin rotation paradox. This paradox also applies to question 17.

It took Gibbs 37 prototypes, all carved out of wood to get this incredible looper shape just right. And then that same shape was used on over 80 models of sewing machines for 80 years. The looper was held by pieces of metal, tightly enough that it didn't fall out, but with enough of a gap for the thread to pass through all the way around. We're showing a simplified model here for clarity. But there's a flaw with this simple way of making a chain stitch. If the thread comes loose, you can easily pull out all the stitching. It's remarkable how quickly and easily the thread gets pulled out because there's barely any friction with the fabric. The only friction holding each stitch in place is the loop from the previous stitch. So once one goes, they just all go in a chain. So people developed more complex chain stitches that use more thread and are more robust. You'll likely find chain stitches holding the hem of your jeans together. You can also embroider beautiful patterns with the chain stitch. Anything that kind of had decorative stitches is what it was originally used for. But then I became used for all kind of lettering and flowers. You're sort of doing gymnastics, figuring out if I feel this direction, where is my next path going to be? You're kind of think ahead of yourself. I think as you become more skilled with the machines too, that's where your work begins to look a lot more refined. Besides the chain stitch, there is a completely different way to secure the thread. And honestly, it's kind of genius. All it requires is two separate schools of thread. Now this school of thread is called the bobbin. So here's how it works. The needle goes through two pieces of fabric. All the way down. And then you pass the second school of thread completely through a loop in the top school. And then bring the needle back up.

I know people have had that problem where, you know, they don't like their 50s. I mean, I really enjoy my 50s. What is the best part about being 50? I think just the relaxation, not worrying so much about things and the boring. I'm not worrying about how people would perceive you. I'm just going to worry about you about that.

And, why did you get good friends? That's what I have now. I think that helped. Have you gave up the idea of being married? No. No? No. You never know, man. Who knows if this haircut I do? I might have somebody for you by the time you get home, man. You can never give up on the idea of love, though. That's right. You can. That is true. I love that, man.

So is it more affordable to get a monster burrito instead? They put down three tortillas and started loading it with stuff, starting with white rice and triple black beans. At this point they already needed two people to move it to the side. They then put three scoops of chicken in all of the toppings, tomato, hot sauce, sour cream, corn, cheese, double guacamole and lettuce. But when they try to roll it up, it did not go as planned. With the power of two people they couldn't get everything to fit into the three tortillas, so they grabbed another one and added it to the middle.

But I think once you reach the right age of 50, any woman should not be interested in thirst trapping on Instagram. I think she has bigger responsibilities. I'm sure she's a very intelligent lady. And she's done amazing things. She's famous. She's obviously very capable. And I think she could do things more interesting than standing around trying to thirst trap on Instagram like she's 18. Because the last thing she's above it. I wasn't insulting her. I was reminding her that she's actually such a fantastic person. She's done such amazing things in her life. And she's so achieved that she's actually above thirst trapping. I was reminding her of her worth. Because as a feminist, we're all feminists here, right? We all believe in women empowerment.

https://vm.tiktok.com/ZT85hdTga/," Take the number 5 and square it. You get 25. Now take 25 and square it. You get 625. Square 625 and you get 390,625. Do you see the pattern? 5 squared ends in a 5. 25 squared ends in 25 and 625 squared ends in 625. So does this pattern continue? Well let's try squaring 390,625. It doesn't quite end in itself, but the last 5 digits match, so it extends the pattern by a few places. So let's try squaring just that part, 90,625. That does end in itself, and if we square that whole number, it also ends in itself. And now we're up to 10 digits. And you can keep doing this, squaring the part of the answer that matches the previous number and increasing the number of digits they share in common. This as though we are converging on a number, but not in the usual sense of convergence. This number will have infinite digits. And if you square it, you'll get back that same number. The number is its own square. Now, I bet you're thinking, does it even make sense to talk about numbers that have infinite digits going off to the left of the decimal point?

Shiven Cartha, Bruce Taub, and Doug Young Rice. I did a lot of math problems when I was young. For the competitions, I'd probably did thousands of math problems. I read it, and I was amazed how badly it's worth it. I just put three down. I figured that's what they wanted. The three students were confident none of the listed answers were correct, and their letters showed it. As a director at the testing service recalled, they didn't say they had come up with possible alternative answers, or that maybe we were wrong. They said flat out, you're wrong, and they proved it. I discussed it with some other people, and said, I think there was a mistake, and they mostly said, and I don't care. I wrote a letter to the educational testing service. It was a little while later. They called us and said, I was correct. Here is their arguments. The simplest version of this problem is with two identical coins. These have the exact same circumference. By our initial logic, this coin should rotate exactly once as it rolls around the other. Let's try it. Okay. But wait, we can see it's already right side up at the halfway point. If we finish rolling it around the other coin, it'll have rotated not once, but twice. One of the coins are the exact same size. There are no tricks here. You can try it for yourself, and I'll do it again slowly. It's one. Two. This is now as the coin rotation paradox. This paradox also applies to question 17. I've made a two-scale model of the problem when useful tip for standardized tests. Even though they say their images are not to scale, they almost always are.

It took Gibbs 37 prototypes, all carved out of wood to get this incredible looper shape just right. And then that same shape was used on over 80 models of sewing machines for 80 years. The looper was held by pieces of metal, tightly enough that it didn't fall out, but with enough of a gap for the thread to pass through all the way around. We're showing a simplified model here for clarity. But there's a flaw with this simple way of making a chain stitch. If the thread comes loose, you can easily pull out all the stitching. It's remarkable how quickly and easily the thread gets pulled out because there's barely any friction with the fabric. The only friction holding each stitch in place is the loop from the previous stitch. So once one goes, they just all go in a chain. So people developed more complex chain stitches that use more thread and are more robust. You'll likely find chain stitches holding the hem of your jeans together. You can also embroider beautiful patterns with the chain stitch. Anything that kind of had decorative stitches is what it was originally used for. But then I became used for all kind of lettering and flowers. You're sort of doing gymnastics, figuring out if I feel this direction, where is my next path going to be? You're kind of think ahead of yourself. I think as you become more skilled with the machines too, that's where your work begins to look a lot more refined. Besides the chain stitch, there is a completely different way to secure the thread. And honestly, it's kind of genius. All it requires is two separate schools of thread. Now this school of thread is called the bobbin. So here's how it works. The needle goes through two pieces of fabric. All the way down. And then you pass the second school of thread completely through a loop in the top school. And then bring the needle back up.
