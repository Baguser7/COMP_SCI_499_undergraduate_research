What are you going to do now? Right here. I got my table and my chair. Sure. Why not? Very good. Come on, man. I got you. What is your name and what do you do? Glenn and I'm a software developer. And how long have you been a software developer for? 26 years. It's a long time to be in a career field. Yeah. Same company, too. Oh, wow. That's a blessing even more. It really is.

I know people have had that problem where, you know, they don't like their 50s. I mean, I really enjoy my 50s. What is the best part about being 50? I think just the relaxation, not worrying so much about things and the boring. I'm not worrying about how people would perceive you. I'm just going to worry about you about that. What do you think the process is to get to a point like that? Competency, self. Competency, who gefunden yourself? Who you are? How you know yourself? And how you perceive yourself? That's what it comes out to. What do you think is the biggest difference in your generation to this one? I think this generation is much for you to, you know, explore things that, when I was growing up, I don't think we had the opportunity to do it. And opportunity to be an opportunity to do it. much for you to explore things that when I was growing up I don't think we had the opportunity to do it and opportunities that come forward in that I don't think we have a million.

Take a day by day. What do you think the best piece of advice that you ever heard? Be kind. Just to be kind of people. You don't know what people are going through at any given time and so don't just assume you know what somebody is doing. Any kind of people is something I think is getting lost.

So is it more affordable to get a monster burrito instead? They put down three tortillas and started loading it with stuff, starting with white rice and triple black beans. At this point they already needed two people to move it to the side. They then put three scoops of chicken in all of the toppings, tomato, hot sauce, sour cream, corn, cheese, double guacamole and lettuce. But when they try to roll it up, it did not go as planned. With the power of two people they couldn't get everything to fit into the three tortillas, so they grabbed another one and added it to the middle.

https://vm.tiktok.com/ZT85hLPpP/," and test takers, just three students wrote about the error to the college board, the company that administers the SAT. Shiven Cartha, Bruce Taub, and Doug Young Rice. I did a lot of math problems when I was young. For the competitions, I'd probably did thousands of math problems. I read it, and I was amazed how badly it's worth it. I just put three down. I figured that's what they wanted. The three students were confident none of the listed answers were correct, and their letters showed it. As a director at the testing service recalled, they didn't say they had come up with possible alternative answers, or that maybe we were wrong. They said flat out, you're wrong, and they proved it. I discussed it with some other people, and said, I think there was a mistake, and they mostly said, and I don't care. I wrote a letter to the educational testing service. It was a little while later. They called us and said, I was correct. Here is their arguments. The simplest version of this problem is with two identical coins. These have the exact same circumference. By our initial logic, this coin should rotate exactly once as it rolls around the other. Let's try it. Okay. But wait, we can see it's already right side up at the halfway point. If we finish rolling it around the other coin, it'll have rotated not once, but twice. One of the coins are the exact same size. There are no tricks here. You can try it for yourself, and I'll do it again slowly. It's one. Two. This is now as the coin rotation paradox. This paradox also applies to question 17. I've made a two-scale model of the problem when useful tip for standardized tests. Even though they say their images are not to scale, they almost always are. So when we roll circle A around circle B,"," and test takers, just three students wrote about the era to the college board, the company that administers the SAT. Shiv and Kartha, Bruce, Tog and Doug Youngrace. I did a lot of math problems when I was young. For the competitions, I'd probably did thousands of math problems. I read it. And I was amazed how badly it's worth it. I just put three down. I figured that's what they wanted. The three students were confident none of the listed answers were correct, and their letters showed it. As a director at the testing service recalled, they didn't say they'd come up with possible alternative answers, or that maybe we were wrong. They said, flat out, you're wrong, and they proved it. I just discussed it with some other people, and said, I think there was a mistake, and they mostly said, and then don't care. I wrote a letter to the educational testing service. There was a little while later, they called us and said, I was correct. Here is their argument. The simplest version of this problem is with two identical coins. These have the exact same circumference. So by our initial logic, this coin should rotate exactly once as it rolls around the other. Let's try it. But wait, we can see it's already right side up at the halfway point. If we finish rolling it around the other coin, it'll have rotated not once, but twice. So the coins are the exact same size.

It took Gibbs 37 prototypes, all carved out of wood to get this incredible looper shape just right. And then that same shape was used on over 80 models of sewing machines for 80 years. The looper was held by pieces of metal, tightly enough that it didn't fall out, but with enough of a gap for the thread to pass through all the way around. We're showing a simplified model here for clarity. But there's a flaw with this simple way of making a chain stitch. If the thread comes loose, you can easily pull out all the stitching. It's remarkable how quickly and easily the thread gets pulled out because there's barely any friction with the fabric. The only friction holding each stitch in place is the loop from the previous stitch. So once one goes, they just all go in a chain. So people developed more complex chain stitches that use more thread and are more robust. You'll likely find chain stitches holding the hem of your jeans together. You can also embroider beautiful patterns with the chain stitch. Anything that kind of had decorative stitches is what it was originally used for. But then I became used for all kind of lettering and flowers. You're sort of doing gymnastics, figuring out if I feel this direction, where is my next path going to be? You're kind of think ahead of yourself. I think as you become more skilled with the machines too, that's where your work begins to look a lot more refined. Besides the chain stitch, there is a completely different way to secure the thread. And honestly, it's kind of genius. All it requires is two separate schools of thread. Now this school of thread is called the bobbin. So here's how it works. The needle goes through two pieces of fabric. All the way down. And then you pass the second school of thread completely through a loop in the top school. And then bring the needle back up.
